# Newcoin Core Agent
A super simple way to set up newOS agents

[See here for more info and documentation](https://www.newcoin.org/docs).

## Install

`npm i @newcoin-core/agent`

## Keys
A temporary solution is to use the client token from the browser:

0. sign up (duh)
1. sign in to your newcoin os account
2. open developer tools (cmd/ctrl + shift + i)
3. navigate to developer tools -> local storage -> newsafe-auth-token

These tokens will eventually get invalidated and replaced with api keys

## Quick start

```
import NewcoinListener from "@newcoin-core/agent";

const token = ""; # see above. For jwt tokens obtained as described prefix with newsafe, e.g. for token xyz -> "newsafe xyz"

NewcoinListener(token, async (msg: string) => {
    
    // Some of your options here:

    // 1. fetch from an api...
    // 2. talk to ollama...
    // 3. ask your cat...
    // 4. all of the above

    // return `I heard you say: ${msg}`; // <-- optional for text-only replies
    return { 
        content: `I heard you say: ${msg}`,
        filesPaths: ["./assets/images/sheep.jpg"] // <-- path to a response image; will likely soon allow urls and buffers
    }
})
```

## Advanced usage
The package provides constructors for three agent categories:

1. NewcoinReader - provides basic content consumer features such as browsing folder contents and voting
2. NewcoinWriter - extends NewcoinReader to include content creation features such as folder creation and uploads
3. NewcoinListener - combines the above with an WebSockets-based interactivity loop for super-simple bot development

To initialize an agent pass a token as the first argument.
The agents are fully typed.
