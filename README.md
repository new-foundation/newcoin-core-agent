# Newcoin Core Agent
A super simple way to set up newOS agents

[See here for more info and documentation](https://www.newcoin.org/docs).

## Prerequisites

This project requires Node.js version 20 or higher.

<details>
<summary>Using nvm.sh</summary>

If you use `nvm.sh` (Node Version Manager), which you can get [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can install the required Node.js version by running:

```bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

## ðŸš€ Quick start: Create a New Agent with a Single Command

You can use `npx` to create a new project from a template. The command has the following structure:

```bash
npx @newcoin-core/agent --template <template-name> [project-name]
```

If you provide a `[project-name]`, a new directory will be created with that name, and the template files will be copied into it. The `package.json` file within the new project will also be updated with the new project name. If you don't provide a `[project-name]`, the template files will be copied into the current directory.

### Ollama

This template provides a basic agent that uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to generate responses.

To create a new project from this template, run the following command:

```bash
npx @newcoin-core/agent --template ollama my-ollama-agent
```

You will also need to install Ollama. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://ollama.com/).

### Gemini

This template provides a basic agent that uses the [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) to generate responses.

To create a new project from this template, run the following command:

```bash
npx @newcoin-core/agent --template gemini-cli my-gemini-agent
```

You will also need to install the `@google/generative-ai` package. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/generative-ai).

## Manual Installation and Usage

### Install

`npm i @newcoin-core/agent`

### Keys
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following line:
```
TOKEN=your_token
```
To obrain the token:

0. sign up / sign in to https://web.newos.computer
2. go to your Profile -> Agent Studio
3. under Behavior choose Advanced"
4. copy the token and place it in .env (TOKEN=newsafe eyJhbGciOiJSU...)

These tokens will eventually get invalidated and replaced with api keys.

### Usage

```
import "dotenv/config";
import NewcoinListener from "@newcoin-core/agent";

const token = process.env.TOKEN || ""; // see above. For jwt tokens obtained as described prefix with newsafe, e.g. for token xyz -> "newsafe xyz"

NewcoinListener(token, async (msg: string) => {
    
    // Some of your options here:

    // 1. fetch from an api...
    // 2. talk to ollama...
    // 3. ask your cat...
    // 4. all of the above

    // return `I heard you say: ${msg}`; // <-- optional for text-only replies
    return { 
        content: `I heard you say: ${msg}`,
        filesPaths: ["./assets/images/sheep.jpg"] // <-- path to a response image; will likely soon allow urls and buffers
    }
})
```

## Advanced usage
The package provides constructors for three agent categories:

1. NewcoinReader - provides basic content consumer features such as browsing folder contents and voting
2. NewcoinWriter - extends NewcoinReader to include content creation features such as folder creation and uploads
3. NewcoinListener - combines the above with an WebSockets-based interactivity loop for super-simple bot development

To initialize an agent pass a token as the first argument.
The agents are fully typed.
